# project: bsn generator

## bsn generator
The goal for this challenge is to generate multiple valid BSNs.

# single generator
## version 1
This version of the bsn generator allows the user to generate a single bsn. This first version may generate a non valid bsn.

## version 2
Version 2 is build from version 1. the program immediately generates a bsn. After that the user is asked to generate another bsn.

# multiple generator
While I wanted to hand in the single version I looked at the assignment and saw that the program had to generate multiple BSNs so I made a new program.

## version 1
I based the multiple version almost entirely on the single version. To generate multiple BSNs I simply added a for loop and changed some other parts to make the program working again.

## version 2
A check has been added for the number of BSNs.

## version 3
The program has been changed to make it more compact.
