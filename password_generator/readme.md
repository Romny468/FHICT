# project: password generator

## password generator
The goal for this challenge was to program a password generator with some configurable stuff. 

## version 1
The program asks how many characters the password should be, after that the program asks if the user wants numbers and/or special characters included in the password. All of these questions have a build-in check to keep the program from crashing.

## version 2
A defenition was added to make the program more compact.

## version 3
Definition has been changed to make it more compact and versatile.

## version 4
Question was added to make sure the user wants a password with more than 100 characters.

## version 5
deployment check was added. Script check if modules exist and if not, program will exit.
