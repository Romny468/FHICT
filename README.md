# FHICT repository
## Welcome
I'd like to welcome you to my personal FHICT repository. This repositiry is used for sharing code that I have created during my school career.

## FHICT
If you're wondering what FHICT actually stands for, let me explain. FH stands for "Fontys Hogescholen" and ICT stands for "Information & Communication Technology". Fontys is the place I'm currently studying at, which is located in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. ICT is the bachelor's degree in IT in my country.
